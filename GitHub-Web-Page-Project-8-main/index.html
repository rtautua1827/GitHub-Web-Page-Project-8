                Indian saffron is richer, darker in its red-orange color then the Spanish or Italian, and gives a better
                flavor to rice.
                The saffron should always be steeped in hot water ahead of time and used as part of the liquid in the
                recipe. The
                following is a recipe prepared in the Indian manner.

                    <li>In a skillet that can be tightly covered, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the
                        rice and salt. Cook,
                        stirring constantly, until the rice begins to absorb the butter and becomes opaque, but do not
                        brown the rice.</li>
                    <li>Quickly pour in the remaining 1 1/2 cups boiling water along with the saffron water. Cover
                        immediately, reduce heat to
                        low, and cook 20 minutes, or until all of the liquid is absorbed. For best results, do not

                    <li>Remove any visible fat. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.</li>
                    <li>Drain well. Mix with the salt, pepper, rice wine (if you didn’t use milk) garlic, and ginger.
                        Let it sit for 20 to 30
                        minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a pan, add all the sauce ingredients, and stir well. Bring it to a boil. When it starts to
                        bubble, reduce the heat to
                        medium low, and simmer until it thickens slightly, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the heat off.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coat each chicken piece well with the potato (or corn) starch.

                    <li>
                        Pour about 1 inch of oil in to a heavy bottom pan. Use a narrow and deep pan if available, When
                        the oil is sufficiently
                        hot (330°F), drop the chicken pieces in one at a time. Fry them in two batches. Overcrowding
                        will drop the oil
                        temperature too quickly. Cook until light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove and set them on
                        a wire rack or a paper
                        towel-lined plate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reheat the oil to 330°F. Deep fry again until golden brown, about a minute or two. You can do
                        the second frying in one
                        batch.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat the sauce over medium low heat. Add the chicken and stir well until the chicken pieces are
                        evenly coated
